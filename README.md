# ETL-Processing
EXPECTATIONS
● You are required to write the software that works similar to the sample inputs given and generates output as
shown in the Input-Output section.
● You should demonstrate the working software by building a console application or writing test program that
exercises the sample inputs. For this purpose, you may use JUnit or any other testing framework.
● Maturity of your solution will be judged on your object oriented programming (or functional programming) and
design skills.
NOT REQUIRED
● Solution to this assignment DO NOT REQUIRE any knowledge of relational database or OS / platform underlying.
● Use of any standard development kit (like JDK) should suffice to write solution to this problem. Usage of
additional libraries or frameworks (like Spring) is NOT EXPECTED in this assignment.

Story#1
As the ETL process engineer, I want to write a program, which does
- Read all text files from a given source directory,
- Transform first letter of each word into capital and
- Write output of each input file into new output file in the destination directory
  So that all contents of all files from the input directory are in INITCAP style.
